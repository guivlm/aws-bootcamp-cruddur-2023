# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

### 1 - Create an Admin User:

**Notes:** This user has been created through the AWS UI by accessing IAM (Identity and Access Management).

---

### 2 - Set MFA Admin User:

**Notes:** I've had the opportunity to enable Multi-Factor Authentication for both my created users: Root & Admin.
In this case, I've used my iPad with Google Authenticator as a method for verifying the identity.

---

### 3 - Set IAM role to Admin User:

**Notes:** In this case, I've created a group named "Admin" and assigned the standard "Administrator" policy access under it.
The Admin user has been assigned to the Admin Group.

---

### 4 - Generate AWS Credentials:

**Notes:** I had the opportunity to explore the AWS Command Line Interface with some commands, as well as to explore the related documentation.

---

### 5 - Install AWS CLI

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20449025/218705873-59fbb350-489a-4940-9deb-df360efa115e.png">

**Notes:** I already had the AWS CLI installed on my machine.
With that being said, I've had the opportunity to explore Gitpod for the very first time.
I admired how it's easy to use that tool to provision different environments/branches integrated with Git.
Another learning was about creating automation to setup the Gitpod environment for whenever the system starts.
I could have used my local VSCode, but once it was the first time I was using Gitpod, I didn't notice the fact that it was consuming credits. This a point to explore in the next lessons.

### 6 - Create a Billing Alarm

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20449025/218706502-9981c553-8b3e-49c7-bfb6-0b0b32555802.png">

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20449025/218711961-b634bdd2-7d74-4530-b3c2-0f09024cf88c.png">

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20449025/218712673-be651d2c-9baf-492d-98f1-2c5feeda97bc.png">

**Notes:** I had the opportunity to create a billing alarm through AWS CLI.
Once I brought a DNS before the bootcamp starts, I was charged more than my target (the least the better) and was able to receive a notification alert almost immediately.
I noticed that the payloads in general with JSON are pretty easy to read and understand, and the documentation covers it very well.

### 7 - Create a budget

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20449025/218707071-ad41d090-a251-4e38-9ceb-5621430e4158.png">

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20449025/218715916-7eb5b719-588f-4290-8416-182314a597d1.png">

**Notes:** I was able to understand the different types of budgets that can be created.
Also, the possibility of creating a budget for credits is pretty cool, once I was able to get some of them from the MongoDB webinar.
I've created one about cost zero and another one regarding the DNS' implicity costs.

### 8 - Use Cloud Shell:

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20449025/218701249-a81b8103-7658-4705-b588-4722ff274d25.png">

**Notes:** A second opportunity for exploring the cloud shell.
It's a great asset when you don't have access to a computer, you can go with it on mobile as well.

---

### 9 - Simple Notification Service (SNS):

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20449025/218714194-0154c046-6450-4915-8b7d-70caef60b4b0.png">

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20449025/218713730-377d01fa-a946-4f6f-898b-8047e80e1dad.png">

**Notes:** In this case, I've logged a support ticket due to overcharging, which was pretty easy and answered fast.
I admired how fast the answer was for a free tier (actually I bought a DNS), but what I meant was about not having any kind of premier support acquired.

---

### 10 - Open a ticket for AWS

<img width="800" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20449025/218710428-c5b46bcb-8672-48fd-8a67-64b48763fbec.png">

**Notes:** On this case, I've logged a support ticket due to overcharging, which was pretty easy and answered fast.
I admired how fast was the answer for a free-tier (actually I bought a DNS), but what I meant was about not having any kind of premier support acquired.

### 11 - Architectural diagrams in Lucid Charts

#### Conceptual Diagram

#### Logical Diagram

**Notes:** I already knew LucidChart because I use to draw Salesforce Architecture Designs in that.
However, it was a quite bit now because I had to understand the application flow better and understand a little bit more regarding the available services in AWS as well to use the right icons. Also, I knew the AWS Architecture Icons portal, which is a great general guideline. I was wondering about making the "napkin" like in the class, but I've decided to make it simpler but modern at the same time.
